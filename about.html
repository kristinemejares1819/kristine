 <center><h3>History</h3></center>
 <p>For years, Amber Ridinger-McLaughlin managed her own skin conditions by using countless costly crèmes, but only experienced marginal results at best. She realized the revitalization of her youthful skin could only occur if she developed the next generation of skincare products herself.

After working closely with beauty scientists and exploring the most advanced ingredients derived from the earth and sea, Amber created this extraordinary line. Lumière de Vie is in a category all its own, yet is more affordable than competing brands.</p>
 <center><h3> Values, Mission, Vision</h3></center>

The extensive line of luxury skincare products is designed to address all skin types and concerns. With the highest-quality natural ingredients and powerful formulas that help heal, soothe, moisturize and protect, Lumière de Vie acts as first aid for your skin.</p>
